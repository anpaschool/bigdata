[["When the Centre for Investigative Journalism-Nepal released its report revealing how over 50 Nepalis exploited secretive tax regimes and broke the country\u2019s law by investing in different offshore companies, sections of the public eagerly anticipated a swift and stringent response from the government. And when the Prime Minister\u2019s Office directed the Financial Information Unit under Nepal Rastra Bank to expedite \u2018a probe into businesses and businesspeople\u2019 last week, those steps appeared to be making ground\u2014at least upon cursory examination. The promise of a \u2018serious probe\u2019 devoid of any comprehensive strategy is not only wholly inadequate but also frustratingly familiar.An almost parallel call was made three years ago, when the Panama Papers, leaked by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, revealed the names of more than 20 Nepalis parking their wealth in a number of tax haven countries and territories."], ["A day after the Panama Papers were exposed in April 2016, the Department of Money Laundering Investigation promised it would \u2018begin a probe\u2019 after calling a meeting of key stakeholders including the Financial Information Unit of Nepal Rastra Bank, the Department of Revenue Investigation and the Nepal Police. Following the meeting, the head of the Department of Money Laundering Investigation promised to adopt a \u2018risk-based supervision system\u2019 and claimed that the Financial Information Unit and the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police would \u2018conduct an investigation\u2019. As recent revelations have indicated, the investigations reaped minimal results in the last two years."], ["In this discouraging context, the call for a probe is far from enough. Until the probe is supplemented with a clear and targeted strategy, the call is meaningless and can not be deemed an adequate response to the Centre for Investigative Journalism-Nepal\u2019s report. One would also think that a necessary prerequisite for a probe would be a well-monitored committee to issue it. At the risk of adding yet another example to its (now growing) list of hollow and foundationless promises, the officials concerned must demonstrate their claimed commitment through tangible results.As Nepal\u2019s third mutual evaluation report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global anti-money laundering watchdog, is nearing its 2020 deadline, time is of the essence\u2014especially as the country faces potential blacklisting. In 2010, when FATF included Nepal in its list of \u2018nations that failed to comply with the action plan related to anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorists\u2019, the government leapt into action, making tangible strides in improving anti-money laundering strategies."], ["In response to the pressure, Parliament devised several legislative measures to monitor money laundering\u2014including the endorsement of the Anti-Money Laundering Act and the establishment of the Department of Money Laundering Investigation in 2011. After being removed from the FATF\u2019s watch list in June 2011, the government seemingly forgot about its commitment to the cause. In the seven years of existence, the Department of Money Laundering Investigation has filed a meagre 40 money laundering cases at the Special Court, and most of them against petty or more low-profile violators. In the past three years, only 10 cases were filed, most of them related to minor charges. This points to a dismal conclusion: Issues related to money laundering only seem to matter when global monitoring organisations intervene"], ["Kathmandu Metropolitan City\u2019s undying infatuation for the preface \u2018smart\u2019 has manifested in several glossy (and costly) infrastructural undertakings\u2014from zebra crossings to dustbins and even toilets. But contrary to what \u2018smart\u2019 suggests, many of these initiatives seem devoid of any intelligent or sustainable solutions to the challenges they claim to address.Take, for example, the \u2018smart dustbins\u2019. From November last year, Kathmandu Metropolitan City, in conjunction with its private partner Krishna Suppliers, began scattering over 70 \u2018smart dustbins\u2019 throughout the city. According to city officials, each dustbin, which is fitted with advertising technology, costs around Rs 600,000. The city plans to install as many as 200 of them\u2014which means the investment will amount to Rs 120,000,000. As of yet, the \u2018smart dustbins\u2019 seem to have made little difference\u2014and in painful visual irony, some of them are even decorated with litter."], ["To add to the erroneous logic, Kathmandu Metropolitan City also recently issued a \u2018crackdown on litter-bugs\u2019\u2014if officials find people throwing any form of waste on the city\u2019s roads, they will be fined up to Rs.5,000. These fines overlook a glaring reality: dustbins are scarce. Rather than spending a gross amount of money on a few \u2018smart dustbins\u2019, why not invest money in ensuring that regular old dustbins are available at every street corner? Or why not redirect attention towards working with the central government to battle the city\u2019s enduring waste management crisis? These steps would address much more than a 6-lakh-worth-of-a-dustbin ever could."], ["Granted, these initiatives are nothing new\u2014they\u2019ve been packaged in various forms and promises throughout the years. But they show that Kathmandu Metropolitan City is overlooking what should be at the heart of any \u2018smart\u2019 city initiative: empowered citizens and sustainable solutions. Kathmandu needs more than glossy, quick fixes that can be added to mayoral repertoires. The tendency to focus on the temporary is exemplified everywhere\u2014from perpetually defunct broomer machines that blow dust in the air in their attempt to \u2018clean Kathmandu\u2019s roads\u2019 to \u2018smart dustbins\u2019 surrounded by litter. Rather than pursuing the glitzy, KMC should prioritise on ensuring that basic necessities\u2014like regular old dustbins and functioning sanitised toilets\u2014serve their intended purposes and are available to all."], ["On Saturday, the Traffic Police at Durbarmarg arrested four Pathao riders. Pathao and Tootle are ride-hailing companies that have been providing unique solutions to Kathmandu\u2019s mobility problems. They connect passengers and drivers who use their personal non-commercial vehicles to provide transportation services as opposed to a regular taxi company that uses commercial vehicles. But according to Nepal\u2019s Motor and Vehicles and Transport Management Act, 1993, private vehicles are not allowed to be used in transportation services. The Taxi Driver\u2019s Association of Nepal\u2014whose market has experienced a disruption since the arrival of services like Tootle and Pathao\u2014filed a legal complaint against the ride-sharing services, highlighting that the act renders them illegal."], ["Yet, having said that, the companies cannot operate without taking responsibility for their actions. The terms and services page of both Tootle and Pathao mention that they are only \u2018a technology company that does not provide or engage in transportation services\u2019. It further mentions that \u2018the company is not a transportation provider\u2019. These statements make it easier for them to shirk responsibility. Also, it does not make them liable for the insurance of the rider or the passenger in case of an accident. As a service provider, ensuring the safety of customers should be any company\u2019s top priority\u2014especially in the business of transportation."], ["The move to shut down these services outright without much deliberation between stakeholder groups is a disservice to commuters and entrepreneurs. Tootle and Pathao are popular services that have made the lives of capital residents much easier by providing a middle-ground option for commuters: more comfortable than public transportation and more affordable than taxis. It is much easier to get in touch with a rider using an app on their phone, hop in, and get to the destination relatively faster and at a much cheaper rate. At the same time, these ride-hailing services are providing employment opportunities to many in the city."], ["Around 30 years, over a dozen missed deadlines, and two terminated contracts since it was first announced, the Melamchi Water Supply Project hangs in limbo, once again. Following months of conflict with the Italian contractor Cooperativa Muratori e Cementisti di Ravenna (CMC), the government has now formally issued a letter of termination, causing further (and seemingly perpetual) delays to the national pride project. Granted, delays to the project stopped surprising people 20 years and over a dozen-missed deadlines ago, but the current fiasco warrants introspection, especially as officials claim that the project is only 5 percent shy of completion."], ["While all parties involved in the construction process have contributed to the current fiasco, one lesson is especially poignant as stakeholders take the next necessary steps to identify a new contractor: more thoughtful deliberation must factor into procurement decisions. A number of factors\u2014including corruption, mismanagement, deviation from contract promises, sluggish cash flow, and a circular bout of finger pointing\u2014has played into the current Melamchi saga. But tussles between contractors and government officials, often manifesting in contract terminations, have featured heavily in these delays."]]
